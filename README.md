# ABURobocon2018
**MATLAB Implemented Modules during ABU Robocon 2018**</br>
**Autonomous and Manual Robots:**</br>
 - Worked with a team of 6 programmers. Built 2 robots - autonomous and manual.
 - Worked on real-time object detection, tracking.
 - Hardware devices: Arduino, Sensors, Actuators, Pneumatic Cylinders, and Rasberry Pi. Used OpenCV, MATLAB and Simulink.</br>
 **Object Detection**
    - Detected Ring Poles in ABU Robocon 2018 using blob analysis. Blob analysis was used as a workflow
for conversion between color spaces, color thresholding, morphological operations.
    - Tracked an the shuttlecock across video frames. Performed object tracking using histogram based
tracking, tracking occluded or hidden objects using a Kalman Filter using MATLAB Simulink.
    - Also used Hough Circle and Canny Edge detection using OpenCV
